## Overview

The challenge was to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I made use of HTML, CSS, Flexbox and it is responsive on all screen sizes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly use google fonts and link them using the @import url()

```css
@import url("https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins");
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to use CSS grid and improve on it as it gave me hard time and I couldn't use it in this project.
